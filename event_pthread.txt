Yes, it is possible to run `ev_run` as a separate thread, but you need to be careful about thread safety and communication between threads. According to the documentation¹, you can use one event loop per thread, but you cannot use the same event loop in multiple threads at the same time. You also need to use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or atomic operations to protect shared data between threads.

To communicate between threads, you can use the `ev_async` watcher¹, which allows you to send an event from one thread to another by calling `ev_async_send`. The receiving thread will then invoke a callback function when it detects the event. You can also use the `ev_signal` watcher¹ to send signals between threads, but this is less portable and reliable.

Here is an example of using `ev_async` to communicate between two threads²:

```c

#include <stdio.h>

#include <pthread.h>

#include <ev.h>

// global variables

struct ev_loop *loop1; // main loop

struct ev_loop *loop2; // worker loop

ev_async async_watcher; // async watcher

int counter = 0; // shared data

// callback function for async event

void async_cb(EV_P_ ev_async *w, int revents)

{

    printf("Async event received\n");

    printf("Counter = %d\n", counter);

}

// callback function for timer event

void timer_cb(EV_P_ ev_timer *w, int revents)

{

    printf("Timer expired\n");

    counter++; // increment shared data

    ev_async_send(loop2, &async_watcher); // send async event to worker loop

}

// function for worker thread

void *worker(void *arg)

{

    printf("Worker thread started\n");

    loop2 = ev_loop_new(0); // create worker loop

    ev_async_init(&async_watcher, async_cb); // initialize async watcher

    ev_async_start(loop2, &async_watcher); // start async watcher

    ev_loop(loop2, 0); // run worker loop

    return NULL;

}

int main()

{

    pthread_t thread; // worker thread

    loop1 = EV_DEFAULT; // create main loop

    ev_timer timer_watcher; // timer watcher

    ev_timer_init(&timer_watcher, timer_cb, 1., 1.); // initialize timer watcher

    ev_timer_start(loop1, &timer_watcher); // start timer watcher

    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, worker, NULL); // create worker thread

    ev_loop(loop1, 0); // run main loop

    pthread_join(thread, NULL); // wait for worker thread

    return 0;

}

```
